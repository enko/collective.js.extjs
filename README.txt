Introduction
============

Ext library started out to be an extension of YUI to provide a set of real world widgets
with complex grids and more. Now Ext is under the sencha project: http://www.sencha.com

Because I'm currently reading the book 'learning Ext JS' I want to make my hand by also
adding Plone Integration.
